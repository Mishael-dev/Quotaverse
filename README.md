I built this project after watching the [JavaScript Mastery's Next.js course](https://youtu.be/wm5gMKuwSYk). Here are the key learnings from the course:

- User authentication ✨
- Next.js fundamentals 🚀
- Data storage with MongoDB and Mongoose 📚
- Data modeling with Mongoose 🧩
- Responsive design 🌟
- React best practices ⚛️
- Working with environment variables 💡
- Next js route handlers 🛒

This course is a valuable learning resource that I highly recommend to anyone pursuing web development. While it is not designed for beginners, it falls within the intermediate level. It exposed me to a wide range of new concepts and techniques. Check it out at [JavaScript Mastery!](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) 🔥
